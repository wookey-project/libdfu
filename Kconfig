  Support for DFU Upload mode of the DFU automaton. The host is
  able to request firmware upload from the device and get back the
  device firmware content.
  WARNING: this feature is a standard DFU function but generates a
  security breach. Activate it only if you know what you do.

  Support for DFU Download mode of the DFU automaton. The host is
  able to flash the device firmware through DFU with a new firmware
  image. This option allows the DFU automaton to accept DFU download
  requests but is not responsible for correct firmware image handling
  (new firmware authentication, integrity, and so on).
